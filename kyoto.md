I've only spent three days in Kyoto, but it's a pretty magical city with lots
of historical places. I feel like it's a lot more proper as a place than any
other cities I've been to, but it's really fun to walk around and explore. Some
of the places here I didn't actually end up going to (three days, only three
days!) but I am putting down anyway cause someone's ought to go!

## Coffee
- [Arabica Kyoto](https://goo.gl/maps/jj7dpaPGbGJ2) - Higashiyama Ward. There
are two locations in Kyoto, but we ended up staying right next to the
Higashiyama location. Really good flat whites, and they do roasting of the
beans in house. Full disclosure, I did buy a bunch of beans home, but they were
not even remotely as good as the flat whites.
- [Weekenders Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/zY7doU1CWCT2) - Nakagyo Ward. I
didn't actually get to have coffee from here because they were closed. It
looked incredibly cute from the outside. It's kind of hidden away in the
parking lot away from the main street. If you're in Kyoto not on a Wednesday,
pls visit for me.
- [Sowgen](https://goo.gl/maps/kaqz8cUu49M2) - Nakagyo Ward. Because Weekenders
was closed, I ended up in this one instead. It's got a bit of a different vibe,
and you have to go through an antique and plant shop before you're in the cafe.
- [Kaikado Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/eXyzCAerXMC2) - Shimogyo Ward. Didn't
actually go to this part of town, but it's been starred on my google maps for
two years, someone please go! It's next to what looks like a really dope garden.
- [Nakagawa Komugiten](https://goo.gl/maps/3BsZouXG6Ty) - Sakyo Ward (I think).
This one is more of a bakery! And is on the way to the Kyoto Botanical Garden.

## Ramen
- [Ichiran](https://goo.gl/maps/zHtMTXdh3oz). If you're stuck, there is always
Ichiran for some tonkotsu. Out of the three days in Kyoto, we've been here
twice o.O.
- [Wajouryoumen Sugari](down://goo.gl/maps/jmPpzy5a1kr). A bit further away
from the touristy spots, and aparently the best rated ramen place in Tokyo. It
was further away from where we were staying, so I haven't actually been. If
anyone goes, let me know how it is!
- [This tiny street](https://goo.gl/maps/ntTFNxf8ymz). **NOT** a ramen place,
but a street with all the cute looking restaurants. Everything is super tiny,
and I think this is a touristy spot. Went into a Yakkinuki place and I can't
remember which one even. Just walk around! Especially really good looking at
night!

## Bars
- [Rum Lovers](https://goo.gl/maps/mELZwqF2eDq). Recomended by a friend! It's
in the really narrow tiny street with all the good food places.
- [Caamm Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/SW9KWvup6hs). Same street as above, but four
blocks north! Also recommended by a friend!
- [jazz spot YAMATOYA](https://goo.gl/maps/z8m2bVa8KBF2). Also a friend
recommendation. Didn't make it out to this one, but looks super chill.

## Stationary (and zakka)
Stationary in Kyoto is also a lot more traditional than all the hip places in
Tokyo o/, just as an fyi.

- [Cotoha](https://goo.gl/maps/TZwk4L58PbB2) - Nakagyo Ward. P L A N T  S T O R
E. (And there is a [coffee shop](https://goo.gl/maps/1sNpHfSj9Hn) near by for
snacking purposes, and a [castle](https://goo.gl/maps/bW5Tx4tEsZp) for castle
purposes.)
- [Rokkaku](https://goo.gl/maps/4aViScDrsEH2) - Nakagyo Ward. v fancy
stationary.
- [Suuzando Hashimoto](https://goo.gl/maps/jt5fXzvz18K2) - Nakagyo Ward. Also v
fancy and v traditional.
- [Kyoto Benrido](kyotobenrido.com) - Nakagyo Ward. This one mostly had lots of
traditional post cards.
- [mumokuteki](https://goo.gl/maps/yJ55PtUscHs) - Nakagyo Ward. This one is a
lot of fun cute things store in the Nishiki Market. There is a bit of
stationary a bit of home goods, basically a fun, a bit more high end zakka
place.

## Places to stay
- [RC Hotel](http://rchotelkyoto.com/archives/93) - Higashiyama Ward. Ahhhh
this place is a concrete lovers brutalist design heaven. It's right in next to
Hokanji pagoda and you get an A+ view. Seriously can't recommend enough.

## Exploring
- [Kyoto Botanical Garden](https://goo.gl/maps/SVjGnAm82NP2). P L A N T S.
- [Fushimi Inari Taisha](https://goo.gl/maps/Wv5LrG6EZ9A2). This one is very
touristy, but if you haven't been definitely should go. Tip: after the first
pit stop, the crowds dissapear. The hike all the way to the top is indeed a
hike, and takes about an hour. There is also a delish food market on the
bottom, so you won't go hungry. Oh, and a [cat
cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/dCtazzNBgAx) also.
- [Shosei-en Garden](https://goo.gl/maps/MQysk9SHLF72). A garden next to (ish)
to the main train station. I only passed by it, but it looked beautiful from
the outside even in December.
- [Kamo River](https://goo.gl/maps/KX4vxCeZQ8D2). Walk along the Kamo River.
It's a super beautiful walk just for the river and the buildings around it.
