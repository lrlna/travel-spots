Ira's lil guide to ldn (stationary, coffee, ramen). More to come, maybe?

## STATIONARY
- [Present & Correct](https://www.presentandcorrect.com/): close to Angel station on the Northern Line. If you end up going there, there is a [cute lil market nearby on the weekends](https://goo.gl/maps/XnjneXZYL3w), and two good coffee shops -- [The Coffee Works Project](https://coffeeworksproject.com/) (has wifi and work spaces) and [Appestat](http://www.appestat.co.uk/). 
- [Choosing & Keeping](https://choosingkeeping.com/): this one is in Bethnal Green on the overground. I like going here when I go to the [Columbia Flower Market](http://www.columbiaroad.info/) on Sundays. It makes for a perfect trifecta: Columbia Flower Market, Brick Lane (have a an english bagel from [Biegel Bagel](http://beigelbake.com/)) and the Barbican. It's a bit of walking, but on a nice autumn day it's a really good walk.
- [Quill](https://quilllondon.com/): this one is also pretty close to Angel station actually. Not as good as Present & Correct, but you might find something you'd like.
- [Labour and Wait](https://www.labourandwait.co.uk/): it's in Shoreditch, and has a few stationary items, but not too many I found. There are, however, a ton of cute lil home goods items, like neat soaps and sponges and storage containers. Also little kits! Like a bike repair kit for example!
- [Monocle](https://monocle.com/): this one is in the fancy Marlybone area. It's good to walk around, and you can have a nice sandwich and a coffee at the Monocle cafe near by!

## Coffee
- [Tap](http://tapcoffee.co.uk/). There are a few locations. Have good coffee, and porridge for breakfast and INTERNET.
- [Origins](https://www.origincoffee.co.uk/). Also a few locations! Sometimes coffee is a bit sour, but it's ok.
- [Highstone brew](https://goo.gl/maps/wCVmFnPc3kR2). If you're going to be in Camden and want a place to read / work from, this one is lovely. It's super unpretensious, but the owner is super sweet and makes her own vegan pastries. Literally used to go here 5 days a week.
- [Attendant](https://the-attendant.com/). This one is in Fitzrovia and used to be a public toilet lol. You walk down the stairs and there are literal stalls. Coffee is actually quite good.
- [Workshop Coffee](https://workshopcoffee.com/). Good brew, sometimes super quiet, sometimes noisey, but nice to chill after you've been walking around for a while. I've only been to the one near Oxford Street, but I think there are 3 more locations.
- [Ace Hotel](http://www.acehotel.com/). Ultimate coworking space. Coffee itself is kind of shit, and food is overpriced. But if you need a place to work in Shoreditch, this is it. 

## RAMEN
- [Kanada-Ya](https://www.kanada-ya.com/). There are two locations, and it's my favourite. Beats any other ramen in London, I think.
- [Ippudo](ippudo.co.uk). Very classic Ippudo, like all the other Ippudo's I've been too. Not spectacular, but v decent broths if I am stuck and craving ramen.
- [Monohon Ramen](http://monohonramen.com/). In Shoreditch! and has v decent broth!
- [Tatami Ramen](https://tatamiramen.co.uk/). On the southbank in a lil food market area next to Mozilla office. I liked it, but it's not a Tonkotsu they say it was. 
- [Nanban](https://www.nanban.co.uk/). If you end up in Brixton, try this one out! Brixton is a p fun area to explore, and there is a ramen joint. yay!
- [Tonkotsu](https://tonkotsu.co.uk/). Their tonkotsu is super super rich, so beware. They do have a few locations so there might be one near by at all times.
- [Menya](https://goo.gl/maps/SZbyXVgL5Yy). I haven't tried this one, it kind of came up as I was going through my starred places. If you end up trying it, let me know what you think!!

There are also Shoryu and Bone Daddies. But I really don't like either of them, so I am not putting them on the list.
