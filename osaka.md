Osaka was a bit too business-y for me. I ended up spending two and a half days
here. It was mostly a walk around kind of few days. Some of the things on the
list are not places I've actually been, just things I've had starred on maps
for a while o/

## Coffee
- [Cafenoto Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/N1f9s91c7SM2) - Higashinari Ward. Just
  off the main street. Seemed like a place with a lot of locals coming by and
chilling.
- [Moda](http://modafabric-coffee.jp/) - Higashinari Ward. It's a fabric store
  upstairs, and a cafe downstairs. Really sweet place, and has a good set of
tables if you feel like computering.
- [Hirofumi Fujita Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/rxrRGDbFwU92) - Higashinari
  Ward. Sort of in the same area as the other two places ^^. Didn't end up
going to this one, since I kept coming back to Cafenoto o/
- [Amazing Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/GEvQkSxTPuR2A) - Orange Street. Ok it's
  a really quirky place with a bus at the entrance. You kind of have to see it.
Flat white are really good, but there isn't seating, so it's take away only.
- [Lilo Coffee Roasters](https://goo.gl/maps/gnvvdQ8Nt5s) - Close to Orange Street.
Haven't actually been, but looks like a place Melbourne coffee places would be proud.

## Food
Food eating in Osaka was very random, so I don't have that many places to
recommend. There was this really good Okonomiyaki place tho.

- [Tsuruhashi Fugetsu Honten](https://goo.gl/maps/kB1fM9CDJJk) - Higashinari
  Ward. O K O N O M I Y A K I ! It's hidden away just outside a larger street,
which is also cool to walk around. The entire area is like a smaller version of
Dotonbori and also feels a bit cyberpunk futuristic.

## Stationary (and zakka)
- [biotop](https://goo.gl/maps/Q8hrXUdbKn52) - Dotonbori. This place is a cafe
  and a homegoods/plants/clothing shop. Idk I really liked it o/. It's on
[Orange Street](https://goo.gl/maps/r2dtXLQbwRo), which is just a cool place to
walk around if you want to do a bit of shopping.
- [graf](https://goo.gl/maps/L5NdKnbLnCu). Home goods store!


## Places to stay
- [Chuan House](http://zaichuan.com/) - Higashinari Ward. It's a v v clean guest house.
  A bit further away from the city centre, but it's really easy to get to
places.

## Exploring
- [Dotonbori](https://goo.gl/maps/gNf4Z1s5Gav). It's a huuuuge light city
  situation. If you are not comfortable with crowds, don't go there. Super fun
to just gaze up - it's neon on neon on neon on neon.
- [Incarceration Plant](https://goo.gl/maps/HMGM3XrK7pK2). Ok this one is a bit
  weird thing to do, and I didn't get to see it IRL cause it's a bit far, but
it's a processing plant with really weirdly decorated buildings. Go look at the
google images of this place; may or may not be up your alley.
- [Cup Noodles Museum](https://www.cupnoodles-museum.jp/). Also didn't get a chance to go
  here, but looks super fun if you're into ramen.
- [Expo Park](https://goo.gl/maps/ziTPNpK8Vao). Osaka had the 1970 expo and
  there is an entire park for it. The park has a super weird gigantic bird
statue that's very 1970. We went here for a ramen festival, but I'd imagine
it's a cool park to see without the ramen festival. There is also a market that
was happening on the same day, but I am not sure if that's a regular occurance
so you'll have to look it up.
