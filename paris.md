Paris is a city I've only been for a few days, but I hope to return soon. This
list is a combination of places I've been to already, or want to go back to
during next visit. 

## Coffee
- [Fragments](https://goo.gl/maps/1sPjZWtzH7t) - 11e Arr. A cute lil place in
  one of the side streets. Their breakfast is real good, but also so is the
coffee.
- [ONI Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/rbB49b4XuAR2) - 10e Arr. Went to this one ~4
  times, mostly cause it was on the way to the Mozilla office :O. Flat whites
are really nice tho. Croissants do the usual french melt-in-your-mouth
situation.
- [Boot Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/BYpBEKW7VwL2A) - 11e Arr. Went in for the
  cute exterior, came out with good coffee.
- [Cafe Kitsune](https://goo.gl/maps/kG6ERjha3Hy) - 2e Arr. Pastries are so
  good here nom nom nom. 

## Food
Not too many food recommendations. I feel like most random places I went to
were amazing anyways o/ 

- [Pink Mama](bigmammagroup.com) - 9e Arr. The interior is the most gorgeous
  thing tbh.
- [Le Petit Canard](https://goo.gl/maps/yoGVg2AHa7L2) - 9e Arr. Everything here
  is duck, and it's amazing. The two people who run the place are super sweet
and good at helping you choose wine. I'd suggest to reserve a table before you
come, cause they turn people away.

## Bars
- [Little Red Door](https://goo.gl/maps/33PwfkdYnXS2) - 11e Arr. Fancy
  delicious stuff.

## Sorta touristy-ish stuff
- [Jardin des Plantes](https://goo.gl/maps/VTMVN2RspJz) - 13e Arr. Love this
  garden!! The greenhouses are 7 euros to get in, but I think are super worth
it. If the weather is nice, and there is time, would have lunch in the garden
for sure.
- [Musée d'Histoire de la Médecine](https://goo.gl/maps/prySSJvViSw) - 7e Arr?
Shout out to Vanessa for suggesting this place! This is a super tiny museum of
medicine. You kind of have to go through the university backdoors to get in,
but it's kind of cool and unusual. The entire museum is one fairly large room,
so you're technically done in 20min. It's 3 euros to get in. Fair warning, the
descriptions are all in French, but I think it might be okay for non-french
speakers too.
- [Grand Palais](https://goo.gl/maps/QRxgVKyf8sp) - 8e Arr. They had this
  amazing exhibition called Artistes et Robots, and it was magnificent. To
avoid waiting in line, buy your entrance ticket [online](grandpalais.fr)
- [Museum Pass](http://en.parismuseumpass.com). I didn't get this one myself,
  but a friend Sarah mentioned this was her go to thing to get for museums in
Paris. Gets you to avoid queues and it's cheaper overall if you're doing a lot
of museums.
- [L'oasis D'Aboukir](https://goo.gl/maps/XKvWvw5vWJ62) - 2e Arr. This is a 10
  story building that's just covered with a vertical garden. Kind of a cool
thing to see. 
- Montmarte, but go at night, and with a bottle of wine. I feel like during the
  day there are bigillion tourists.
