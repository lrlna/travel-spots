I've only been to Tokyo twice so far, so these are not `tips from a local` kind
of situation, but more of a list of things I've researched and been to as a
tourist.  Also. I am pretty shit at figuring out what the neighbourhoods are
called exactly, but I will try to give you a general idea as to what's where at
least approximately.

## Coffee
- [Little Nap Coffee Roasters](http://littlenap.jp/) - Uehara. This place has really
darn good coffee and flat whites. There are two locations, one near Yoyogi
Park, and one sort of close in Uehara. Grab a bag of beans if you're into
bringing coffee beans back home.
- [Fuglen Tokyo](http://fuglen.com/) - Shibuya-ku. Fuglen is walking distance from
Little Nap coffee roasters and is in Shibuya-ku. It's a little Nordic feel cafe
and there are a few tables to work from. Can't remember if there is wifi tho.
- [Open Source Cafe](http://osscafe.net/) - Shimokitazawa. This is not a place for
amazing flat whites, but more of a place to get some work done. You pay I think
~1000 Yen for the day and get a beverage with it. The people who run the place
are super sweet, and the people you meet there hack on some super cool stuff.
- [Koffee Mameya](http://koffee-mameya.com/) - Omote-sando. This place only does
pour-over cofee. There is no seating areas and you get a take away cup when you
order. Be prepared to pay ~900 Yen for a cup, but it will be the best coffee
you'll ever have. I've literally never had **better coffee in my entire life**. 
- [Streamer Coffee Company](http://streamer.coffee/) - Omote-sando. This place is good
for flat-white/capuccino situation, there is also wifi i think, and places to
work!
- [Sol's Coffee Stand](http://sols-coffee.com/) - Taito. Super tiny lil place in a
super tiny cute lil side street. Good for all your milk coffee variations.
- [Unir Speciality Coffee](http://unir-coffee.com/) - Akasaka. This place is open
24hrs, and has decent coffee, and I think I spent way too many evenings in this
cafe the first time I was in Tokyo hacking on a bunch of stuff. TL;DR good
hacking space.
- [Nozy Coffee](http://nozycoffee.jp/) - Meguro. This is next to Setagaya Park, and is
a good break from walking around if you're in that area.
- [Coffea Exlibris](https://goo.gl/maps/59gcmUhWUHU2) - Shimokitazawa. It's a
bit further away from Shimokitazawa's shopping area, but a really nice escape
for some good food and coffeee.
- [Shozo Coffee](http://www.shozo.co.jp/) - Omote-sando. This place is a bit hidden away
from the main shopping street. It's got good pour-overs, and is part of this
really interesting group of shops / restaurants that share a courtyard with
tables. I'd just go there to check out the space, espeically if you're in the
area. 

## Stationary
Not quite entirely stationary, I think more of a
[zakka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakka) list. Promise that everything on
here is cute.

#### Omote-sando
- [galerie doux dimanche](http://2dimanche.com/). Ultra cute stuff, and closet to Kofee
Mameya from above. 
- [UTRECHT](http://utrecht.jp/). This is sort of a book shop, sort of a stationary
store. Lots of cute lil things.
- [MUJI in Aoyama](https://goo.gl/maps/3humJXA7gws). This place is huge, and is
the only "large retailer" on this list. 
- [&note](https://www.and-note.com/). Close to Harajuku station in a little side street.
It's a very tiny lil stand with cute Zakka.

#### Roppongi
- [UGUiSU, the little shoppe](http://uguisulittleshoppe.com/). It's **super tiny**, but
has really cute stuff. Might be hard to find cause you gotta go down a set of
stairs after crossing the street to get to the actual street that has this
store. Don't lose patience -- both the street and store are worth it.

#### Taito
- [inkstand](https://goo.gl/maps/75mmsGnuTXt). This place is specifically for
these fountain pens, you can mix your own ink and stuff. Kind of cool.
- [Kakimori](http://kakimori.com/). Oh boy, this place lets you make your own notebooks
and stuff, and it's pretty huge for an independant store. I still regret not
buying this 3000 Yen brush pen, but it was also 3000 Yen.

#### Meguro
- [Traveler's Factory](https://www.travelers-factory.com/). As usual, this place is also a
bit hidden away, but comes with a two stories and a cafe with what looks like
very decent coffee (didn't have coffee at this one yet).
- [Heiji](http://heidi-home.com/). Lots of random homey things! I think this place is
an epitome of what Zakka is.
- [colobockle](http://colobockle.jp). Ok, this place was closed when I was in the area
to check it out, so I can't speak about the quality of stuff. Looked super cute
from the outside tho.
- [BRICK & MORTAR](http://brickandmortar.jp/). This place was also closed, and it's
across the street from colobockle. It looked like antiques, Zakka, stationary
and clothing store from the outside tho, so I'd definitely come back.
- [mu * mu](http://mumu66.com/). Here just for the name tbh. It's a place with a bunch
of antiques.

## Fav Hoods
I obviously haven't explored enough of anything in Tokyo. But both of the times
I've been, I've came back to these three.
- [Shimokitazawa](https://goo.gl/maps/hK75D5bAoFr). So many good vintage shops
and just clothing shops. Deifnitely came back three times to this area already,
I think.
- [Yoyogi / Uehara](https://goo.gl/maps/CVwWHKBMXfo). This is really close to
the Yoyogi park, but it's on the other side of the Harajuku station, so it's
not as busy. I really liked walking around there, and there is one my fav
coffee places aroudn -- Little Nap Coffee Roasters. The area is p chill on its
own. 
- [Naka-Meguro / Kami-meguro](https://goo.gl/maps/K7ZF61Qv4aJ2). I feel like
all of Meguro is pretty great tho.  Loads of really hip clothing shops and
stationary stores. Also feels really chill, especially in comparison to
Omote-sando / Harajuku area that's neighbouring to this one.

## Places to stay
Errr I don't have any special recomendations for really nice places, but here
is where I've stayed so far. They've all been good and really clean.

- [Book and Bed Asakusa](http://bookandbedtokyo.com/). This is a "capsule hotel". It's
a really hip one, there are definitely books everywhere for you to read. The
main area is a giant table to work from, or read. There are about a million
nooks to hide and read, if you want that too. They have amazingly good coffee
you can get for breakfast too. Idk, would definitely stay again, and there are
two locations.
- [APA Hotels](https://apahotel.com/). There are 5 or 6 of them around Tokyo. They are
cheap, but super tiny. Just be aware of that. Obviously everything is spotless.
- [Centurion Capsule Hotel](http://centurion-hotel.com/). This was 20 euros a night,
and there is a super amazing shared bath.
- [Tama Ryokan](http://tamaryokan.com/). If you want to try staying at a Ryokan, this
place is p great. The owner is incredibly sweet and very caring. It's in a lil
side street away from the main action, so you get a good night's sleep at
night.

## Bars
- [Imanari](https://goo.gl/maps/5SWPKbtE5o62) - Shimokitazawa. I've been here
on both trips. Beer and Highballs are 180 Yen, and I think that's enough said.
- [Flower Bar Gardena](https://goo.gl/maps/q83tDcKFw7s) - Shimokitazawa. This
is a flower shop during the day, and a bar at night, which is I think the
reason I've came here in the first place. 
- [Solfa](http://nakameguro-solfa.com/) - Meguro. A bar / event space a friend told me
  about. I'd check the schedule to see who is playing what.

## Food places
I've literally never had bad food in Japan. I feel like you can just blindly
throw a stone and end up with a meal of your life. But here are a few places I
really enjoyed that might not be that obvious.

- [Yazawa](https://goo.gl/maps/fZb2ZzaLrWN2) - Shimokitazawa. This is a
Yakiniku place, and I feel like there was something very cheap or unlimited
beer. I can't quite remember tho.
- [hocus pocus](https://goo.gl/maps/qpiU7FnRSwL2). :doughnut: donut place!
- [Konjiki](https://goo.gl/maps/J2gcgh5ck8A2). The really good ramen place
  according to most people who are into ramen.
- [Kikanbo](https://goo.gl/maps/C2YyUKUfZSE2). Ramen :ramen:. I've had this one
  starred, but I can't actually remember if I went (all the ramen eating in
Tokyo is a blur for me, so much good ramen).
- [Ramen place in Taito](https://goo.gl/maps/jT8uAFKVdVu). This one was
  recommended by a local. Haven't actually been but the person was adamant to
say it was really good, so I believe them.

## Things to see
- [Shinjuku Garden Greenhouse](https://goo.gl/maps/hRK1izi3pqx). `~P~L~A~N~T~S~`!
- [Yoyogi Park](https://goo.gl/maps/3aiPxDjXKJw). It's my fav park ever I
  think. Always down to walk around it. Only ever been in the fall tho, but I'd
assume it's a good park year round.
- [Art shop / gallery thing](https://goo.gl/maps/TtWPcQszbe72). It's in Meguro and a bit of a
conglameration of a shop with some art. If you're in the area, I'd say go for
it!
- [Tsukiji Market](https://goo.gl/maps/d8ARLdHVFaS2). I think everyone talks
  about this one, so nothing new here. Just going to add that all the fish I've
had here has been delish.
