This information might be out of date, since last I lived in Vancouver was over a year ago, so maybe things have changed, and new places popped up. This is a list of my favs when I lived there :D I mostly lived in Vancouver-Vancouver and Downtown parts of town, so this information is based around that as well. There might be good places out in other parts of the city that you should definitely explore if you can!

## Ramen:
1. [Ramen Jinya](jinya-ramenbar.com) is *amazing*. Their Tonkotsu broth is nom nom nom, and they also do take out if you're stuck and don't want to wait in the queue (cause they have queues).
2. [Ramen Butcher](theramenbutcher.com). In Chinatown part of the city, which is an awesome place to explore and walk around to begin with, but also their Tonkotsu is üëåüèæ üëåüèæ. 
3. [Ramen Koika](https://www.ramenkoika.com/). In the West End! Close to the Sea Wall, and on Davie street, which is an awesome place to walk around in general!!
4. [Ramen Gojiro](http://ramengojiro.com/). They have a different take on ramen, and do have a queue (or at least they used to).
5. [Menya Ramen](http://menyaramen.com/). It's cheap and quick, and really delicious. It's a bit further away from Downtown, but if you're in downtown, just walk over the Cambie bridge, which is always a nice walk.
6. [Gyoza Bar](https://gyozabar.ca). Ok, it's not my favourite, but it's also not always busy, so sometimes I did go here. Their gyoza is good too, and they do have straight up Tonkotsu, which not all places have.
7. [Harvest Community Foods](harvestunion.ca). They don't do the traditional ramen. In fact, it's not even a japanese restaurant, but a food store that sells lunch. I do, however, like their take on ramen. The broth is *a lot* ligthter than my usual fav -- Tonkotsu. Good for lunch if you're in the area!

There are *a bunch* more. Ramen in Vancouver is amazing, and, quite frankly so is most of Japanese restaurants. Depending on the area you're staying, just google 'ramen', and you're probably gonna be near a good place. The above are just my favourites (in order of preference).

## Coffee:
Okkkkkk r u ready?
1. [Matchstick](matchstickyvr.com). There is one in Chinatown, and one on Fraser Street. Both are amazing, and have good food. It's more of a European style cafe (which I have decided after I lived in Europe for a bit) than you're typical coffee shop you'd have in NA. But they do roast their beans, and their beans are amazing! __There is wifi__.
2. [Timbertrain](timbertraincoffeeroasters.com). I am torn between their beans and Matchstick beans, so these two are tied for 1st place. Have an almond croissant for me plsssssss. __There is wifi__, but the place is small to work from, but you still can (done it a bunch of times).
3. [Propoganda Coffee](propagandacoffee.ca). Last time I was there, they didn't roast their coffee, but do have the above ^^ two roasteries beans. There are a *lot of large tables* to work from, and __there is wifi__. 
4. [Birds & the Beets](birdsandbeets.ca). Good food and good coffee. Also super cute! They have tables to work from, but __there is NO wifi__, so this is an offline coffee shop.
5. [Elysian Coffee](elysiancoffee.com). There are two locations, one on Broadway, one on Ontario streets. I am kind of torn on their beans, sometimes they are good, sometimes not. They have amazing pastries tho!! Lil Amaretti cookies and cheese scones are nom nom nokm. Afaik, __there is NO wifi__. Offline only coffee shop!
6. [Rocaccini Coffee Roasters](rocanini.com). Beans are ok, but they have good tables to work from! __There is wifi__
7. [Gene Coffee Bar](genecoffeebar.com). It's a cute lil place to grab a coffee, not a work place for sure. It's in the corner of the street, so it's kind of cool like that. Sit in that same corner, cause you get the view of downtown and mountains, which is üòç. Also it's on Main Street, which is an awesome area to walk around and see some cute shops. 
8. [Kafka's](kafkascoffee.ca). I think I am more nostalgic about this place than anything -- spent quite a few days there studying in Uni. Coffee is great, pastries are also amazing! __There is wifi__.
9. [Aubade Coffee](aubadecoffee.info). This one is new I just discovered last time I went! It's a good place to just grab a coffee and chill and look at antiques if that's what you're in the mood for. 
10. [49th Parallel](49thcoffee.com). I find their beans a bit too acidic for my taste, HOWEVER, their Main Street Location is together with Lucky's donuts, so I forgive their beans sometimes. It's also on Main street, which is a nice area to walk around like I mentioned before! __There is NO wifi__ (afaik).

## Breweries:
Ok, there are a lot of breweries, most are in East Vancouver. I suggest doing a bit of a brewery hop, since most of them are within a 5-20min walk of one another :O. Pro-tip: intervine them with places that have food trucks outside, so you get yourself fed and don't get drunk too quickly (you will get drunk, however). I am gonna group them for ya.
#### Group 1: Main street. 
- [33 Acres](http://33acresbrewing.com/). Small and adorable. Really freaking good beer that I really miss. There is sometimes a food truck outside with delicious food! But they do sell small plates so you don't get too drunk too quickly. There is also a Mariachi band playing on some nights (I feel like it's Thursdays, but I might be wrong!!) 
- [Brassneck](brassneck.ca). Also small, but a bit bigger than 33 Acres. Beer is also amazing! There is also a food truck outside with food!!
- [Main Street Brewery](
mainstreetbeer.ca). Quite a bit bigger than the other two, and they do have a more-than-a-nibble of a food selection.
#### Group 2: (South Side of) East Van.
Could technically be grouped with group 3, they are all kind of close.
- [Luppolo Brewing](luppolobrewing.ca). They had sours, which was interesting, cause not a lot of places in Vancouver usually do. Otherwise a large enough place for when there are a few of you.
- [Bomber Brewing](bomberbrewing.com). This one is also tiny! They have good (and v greesy) sandwiches for snacks. Also pickled eggs??? 
- [Off the Rail Brewing](offtherailbrewing.com). It's tiny! But a good stop after or before you go to Bomber! You gotta walk up the stairs, it's on the second floor (in case you're confused how to get in).
- [Strange Fellows Brewing](strangefellowsbrewing.com). Ok, I haven't actually been to this one, it must be new, but it's in the area. Check it out and let me know.
#### Group 3: East Van (around Hastings).
Again, you can probably do mix and match group 2 and 3. 
- [Parallel 49th](parallel49brewing.com). It's pretty popular, and has been around foreverrrr. I'd think they were the ones to start the whole brewery culture in Vancouver? But it might be Steamworks? Idk?
- [Strathacona Brewing](http://www.strathconabeer.com/). THEY HAVE PIZZA! Also a fairly darn large place!
- [Powell Brewery](powellbeer.com). Also one of the originals!
- [Doan's Craft Brewery](http://doanscraftbrewing.com/). I *feel* like they've changed locations. The original place on Hastings was incredibly tiny, but this one might be bigger?
- [Storm Brewing](https://www.stormbrewing.org/). I am yet to go here! Plssss report back!
- [Callister Brewing](http://www.callisterbrewing.com/). Also yet to go here! Pls report back. 
- [Postmark Brewing](). It's a bit further away from all of the above, but there is no other breweries near by, so I just grouped it with them. They have food, but it's a bit pricey imo. And it's also a winery? So like half brewery, half winery place?

## Food:
A list of food outside of ramen shops lol. Food places are widely diverse. You can have everything from amazing Korean BBQ to amazing dim sum to a really good eggs benny brunch. I am just gonna list out a few of my favourites ‚úåüèø
#### Sushi.
Ahhh honestly any sushi restaurant is good. It's very rare that you won't find a good one. Here are three that are pretty cheap and good 
- [Tsuki Sushi](tsukisushibar.ca). This one is a bit fancier than the two below, but really realllyyy good rolls.
- [House of Sushi Bowl](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Kyzock+%2F+House+of+Sushi+Bowl/@49.2837688,-123.1134747,17.76z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1ssushi+vancouver!3m4!1s0x0:0xe3c7a0c2d2b2c54f!8m2!3d49.283843!4d-123.1133649) I am not sure if it's this one that's good, or the one that's [right next to it](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Sushi+Spin+Roll/@49.2837688,-123.1134747,17.76z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1ssushi+vancouver!3m4!1s0x0:0xe4810d7abdcf0a41!8m2!3d49.2837232!4d-123.113202)! But I do think it's House of Sushi Bowl!! It's cheap and super super delicious.
- [Sushi Den](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Sushi+Den/@49.2781794,-123.1232761,15z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1ssushi+vancouver!3m4!1s0x0:0x5af99b74cb6d92af!8m2!3d49.2794246!4d-123.1078443).
- [Ogenki](ogenkisushi.ca). It's further away from downtown, but in case you're lost walking around on Main Street, this place is good! Used to go hear all the time, and sushi is quite cheap, and they are quick!

A few fancier places:
- [Black Rice Izakaya](http://www.blackrice.ca/).
- [Hapa Izakaya](hapaizakaya.com).
- [Minami](minamirestaurant.com). I haven't been to this one cause I could never afford it lol, but everyone who's been says it's amazing.

#### Not sushi.
- [Nuba](nuba.ca). Reallyyyy amazing Lebanese food!
- [Chambar](chambar.com). It's kind of expensive for dinner, but I do like a good brunch there! 'Belgian' is the category I'd think. Pls have a waffle if you go for brunch.
- [Gyu Kaku](gyu-kaku.com). Really amazing Japanese BBQ!! Go in a larger group cause you can try more things!
- [La Taqueria](lataqueria.ca). it's way toooo good of a lunch place tbh. I think $10 for 4 tacos?
- [Meat && Bread](meatandbread.com). LUNCH. the name speaks for itself.
- [Bestie](bestie.ca) Also Lunch? But i gues also a dinner thing? German sausages and pretzels.
- [Stepho's Souvlaki](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Stepho's+Souvlaki+Greek+Taverna/@49.2784463,-123.1309791,16z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1srestaurant+vancouver!3m4!1s0x0:0x6be778e7ecae3ede!8m2!3d49.2807439!4d-123.13196). This Greek restaurant has a queue, and really gigantic portions.
- [Sura](surakoreancuisine.com). Delicious Korean place!
- [Dae-ji](daejifood.com). Cheap and delicious Korean place. They've got two locations one in West End and one near Waterfront.
- [Afghan Horsmen](afghanhorsemen.com). It's next to granville island, which is a nice area to explore. I find all the restaurants there a bit touristy, EXCEPT this one!
- [Naam](thenaam.com). 24 hour vegeterian restaurant. I hope they are still 24hr?
- [East is East](eastiseast.ca). There are two locations! One on Main Street, one on Broadway. Afghani food, mostly. I think there might be a few variations. I think they have only one meat option (or 0), so mostly vegetarian.
- [Congee Noodle House](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Congee+Noodle+House/@49.2631317,-123.1025714,19.39z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sfood!3m4!1s0x0:0xcb3f892289e7a398!8m2!3d49.263084!4d-123.1020899). I've had a bunch of late-night-i-had-a-bunch-to-drink meals here. Come in a group!
- [Phnom Penh](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Phnom+Penh+Restaurant/@49.2768714,-123.1012084,16.88z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sfood!3m4!1s0x0:0x4e43d6ef30d0b5df!8m2!3d49.2783642!4d-123.0982232). There is a queue (i've never had to wait less than 30min), but you're not going to regret it.
- [Yolks](yolks.ca) BRUNCH! There are two locations and a food truck during the week near Cambie Street Station.

## Karaoke:
'Cause someone is going to ask. I've only ever been to these one, and it's been consistently good. There are probably a ton more, but they are not in downtown/vancouver area. I feel like Richmond has a bunch.
- [Fantacity](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Fantacity/@49.2850355,-123.1301884,15.64z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1skaraoke+vancouver!3m4!1s0x0:0xd5a1a1e196dfdbf3!8m2!3d49.2852528!4d-123.1254476)

## Ice Cream:
- [Earnest](earnesticecream.com). Have whisky hazelnut for me.
- [Soft Peaks](softpeaks.ca). Heh it's all made with honey :D
- [Bella Gelateria](bellagelateria.com). Have the sesame one for me.

## Hikes:
If you're in Vancouver, you gotta go for a hike. It's a must. Here is a list of my favourites. Most of these are public transport accessible.
- [Grouse Mountain BCMC Trail](https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/bcmc-trail/). This trail is right next to Grouse Grind, but a **lot** less crowded. Gets you up to the same top, with the same workout for the same view. For extra workout, head up to [Crown Mountain](https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/crown-mountain/)
- [Lynn Valley Trails](https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/lynn-loop/). This trail is super fun. You can do a bunch of different variations once you get there: shorter loop, longer loop, a hike up to Lynn Peak for a nice view, or head over to the [Norvan Falls](https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/norvan-falls/) midway throught the longer loop. 10/10 would recommend.
- [Capilano Canyon](https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/capilano-canyon/). If you don't want to pay for Capilano Suspension Bridge Park, but still want to see the canyons, head over to this trail. It's super fun, and if you go in the spring, there are about bijillion salmons jumping around in the river. It's super cute.
- [Squamish Chief](https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/stawamus-chief/). This one is in Howe sound, so you do have to drive from Vancouver. The view from either of three Peaks is amazing. I'd suggest leaving Vancouver early enough to get here by about 7.30. It gets really crowded afterwards. Peak #1 is the busiest, so heading off to Peak #2 or #3 is advisable.
- [Query Rock](https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/quarry-rock/). This one is nice and short ~4km. You can keep going and get to Grouse I think, but it gets really long. There is a beautiful like below when you start. You can rent Kayaks there to swoosh around. Recommend!

## Fun stuff:
Random stuff around town that's kind of interesting:
- [Beer Island](https://goo.gl/maps/47cyscZH4D62). You can't drink in public in Canada, but if you're sneaky enough like everyone else that comes to this place, you can totally do it. Grab a beer from 33 Acres before you come. Also 'island' is an overstatement. It's super tiny. Also be careful of tides, otherwise you will have to get your ankles wet.
- [Third Beach](https://goo.gl/maps/P1F2sNsPtsK2). This one is around Stanley Park. I prefer third beach over second, cause it's usually farther to get to, so there are less people. 
- [Bard on the Beach](https://bardonthebeach.org/). Not at 3rd Beach, but in Kitsilano! Every summer up until the end of September I think, there is a set of Shakespeare plays getting played in open air. You're in a tent, but you do get to see the sunset. If you get a ticket, bring a blanket!
- [Vancouver Symphony](https://www.vancouversymphony.ca/concerts/all-access-pass/). If you're under 35, you can get $15 tickets to go see a performance at the symphony. The theatre is rather small, but they put on beautiful pieces. Sometimes there are fun things, like Pixar themed performances.
- [Van Dusen Botanical Gardens](http://vandusengarden.org/). A bit further away from the centre, but incredibly beautiful. 100% would recommend!
- [Crab Park](https://goo.gl/maps/4ahfaD4m5KE2). This one is in Downtown Vancouver. Grab a beer from Portside near by, and bring it over here to watch the sunset. Your views: beautiful mountains, water, really cool looking cranes and shipping containers. Also an occassional helicopter landing. 
- [Vancouver Art Gallery](http://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/). Depends on exhibitions in town. Sometimes there is really cool stuff!
- [JBG Gallery](https://www.thejamesblack.gallery/events2018). A new cool space, that's a little bit underground. They post their exhibitions over instagram/facebook. So if you're in town when they have something on, I suggest to stop by!
- [Davie Street](https://www.tourismvancouver.com/vancouver/neighbourhoods/davie-village/). Queerest spot in town :pray:. Lots of good restaurants and shops. At the end of the street is a beach o/ And also to the side is a beach o/
- [Celebreties Drag Queen Bingo Night](https://www.insidevancouver.ca/2017/10/04/drag-queen-bingo-at-celebrities-nightclub-every-wednesday/). Celebreties is usually a night club, which was lots of fun when I was 20. They also do drag shows! This event is for bingo night, which hopefully is still happening.
- [Night Market in Richmond](https://www.visitrichmondbc.com/food-and-drink/night-markets/). So much amazing Asian food. Come on empty stomach! <-- that location is for the one I haven't been to before, but they probably relocated o/ Tbh, this is a lot more easily accessible. 
- [Day trip to Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia). If you want to take a ferry over to Victoria. It's super fun, and you can do it in a day! It's a really quaint old English town kind of experience.
